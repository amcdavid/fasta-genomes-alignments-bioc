# Aligning, Clustering and Annotating Genomic Sequences

This is a short (and incomplete) tutorial on using Bioconductor to:

*  read and subset sequences
*  interact with genome annotations
*  align sequences
*  cluster sequences

It illustrates these principles with a subsample of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from New York that were submitted to the NCBI.
